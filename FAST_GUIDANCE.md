# Fast Guidance

This file distills the core practices for quick reference.

## Workflow Essentials
- Read the current folder's `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` along with their parents.
- Document planned work before coding.
- Write tests first and aim for at least 60% coverage.
- Run `npm install` and then `npm test` to execute all suites.
- Use Conventional Commit style: `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:` and reference docs/feature or docs/bugfix folders.
- Update documentation and tests whenever behavior changes.

## UI Guidelines
- Keep interfaces simple and consistent.
- Provide feedback and ensure accessibility.

## Spacesim Notes
- Simulation uses Planck.js and has unit tests under `src/`.
- Run `npm install` before building or testing.
