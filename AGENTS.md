# Guidance for AI Coding Agents

Welcome, coding agent! Follow these instructions whenever you work in this repository:

1. **Read Documentation First**
   - Review the current folder's `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` along with those of its parents.
   - Check for additional documentation files referenced within them.
2. **Comply with the Workflow**
   - Follow the process and standards defined in [`CODING_RULES.md`](CODING_RULES.md).
   - Run `npm install` when working with Node-based tooling.
   - Write tests before implementing any change and ensure they all pass.
   - Update documentation for any new or modified feature.
3. **Maintain Local Instructions**
   - Every subfolder contains its own `AGENTS.md` with context-specific guidelines. Read them before editing files in that folder.

This file is part of the initial scaffolding. Refine it as the project grows.
