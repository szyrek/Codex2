# Project Overview

Welcome to Codex2! This repository is scaffolded using **documentation-driven development**. Every directory in this project must include a `README.md` and an `AGENTS.md` file. These documents ensure that both human developers and AI coding agents understand the structure, intent, and rules of the codebase.

- `README.md` explains the purpose of the code within its folder and links to any additional documentation.
- `AGENTS.md` provides AI-specific guidance for contributing safely and consistently.

A detailed workflow for all contributors is defined in [`CODING_RULES.md`](CODING_RULES.md). You should read those guidelines before proposing any changes. Further design or architecture notes may appear in other Markdown files, and they will be referenced from the local `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

This file is part of the initial project scaffolding and will evolve as the project grows.

## Example

See [example/](example/) for a minimal TypeScript web app demonstrating the workflow in action. It provides build scripts, tests and documentation for a complete unit of work.
