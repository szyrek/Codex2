# Shipview Cockpit

- Added a new **Shipview** tab to the UI.
- Presents a basic cockpit layout with three angled panels and a console.
- The centre window is reserved for space imagery or the simulation.
- Moving the mouse to either screen edge now rotates the cockpit.
- The right side reveals a navigation screen running the simulation.
- The left side shows an enlarged console panel.

Tests: `spacesim/src/components/shipView.test.tsx` and `spacesim/src/components/root.test.tsx`.
