# Metric Units

Mass values are now controlled with a slider ranging from a small moon to our Sun.
All distances are displayed and editable in metric units using scientific notation.
Bodies are far less dense so the same mass produces a much larger radius, giving a
sense that planets sit closer together.

Implemented in `spacesim`.

## Tests
- `spacesim/src/units.test.ts`
- `spacesim/src/components/bodyEditor.test.tsx`
