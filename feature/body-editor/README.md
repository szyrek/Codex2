# Body Editor

Clicking an existing body opens a panel to inspect and edit its data.

- Allows changing name, mass, radius and color, then applying changes.
- Delete removes the body and closes the editor.
- The editor stays open after applying and closes when you click elsewhere.
- Implemented in `spacesim`.
- End-to-end coverage: `spacesim/e2e/edit.spec.ts`.
