# Configuration View

A new **Config** tab shows preferences like ship name, volume and graphics quality.
Values are hardcoded for now so end-to-end tests can verify the UI without a backend.
The layout centres a datapad-style panel within the viewport to allow future spaceship background artwork.

- Implemented in `spacesim`.
- End-to-end coverage: `spacesim/e2e/config.spec.ts`.
